# Scheduler
Scheduler is a fully managed cron job scheduler. It allows you to schedule
virtually any job (e.g. such as calling HTTP/S endpoints). You can automate
everything, including retries in case of failure, run jobs right away, on a recurring
schedule, or at some point in the future.

Scheduler allows you to manage all of your automation tasks in a single place via
simple UI or command line.
