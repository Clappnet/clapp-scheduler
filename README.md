# Scheduler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akornatskyy/scheduler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akornatskyy/scheduler)

The scheduler is a fully managed cron job scheduler. It allows you to schedule
virtually any job (e.g. such as calling HTTP/S endpoints). You can automate
everything, including retries in case of failure, run jobs right away, on a
recurring schedule, or at some point in the future.

The scheduler allows you to manage all of your automation tasks in a single place
via simple UI or command line.
